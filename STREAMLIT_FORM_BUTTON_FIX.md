# Streamlit Form Button Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing a StreamlitAPIException:
```
st.button() can't be used in an st.form().
For more information, refer to the documentation for forms.
Traceback: File "app.py", line 198
if st.button("üîê Go to Login", key="reg_success_login"):
```

## Root Cause
In Streamlit, regular `st.button()` cannot be used inside `st.form()` blocks. Only `st.form_submit_button()` is allowed inside forms.

The issue was that the "Go to Login" button was placed inside the registration form:

```python
with st.form("registration_form"):
    # ... form content ...
    if success:
        st.success("‚úÖ Account created successfully!")
        # ‚ùå This button was inside the form
        if st.button("üîê Go to Login", key="reg_success_login"):
            st.rerun()
```

## Solution
Moved the login button outside the form by:

1. **Using session state to track success**: Store registration success in session state
2. **Moving button outside form**: Place the button at the same indentation level as the form
3. **Proper state management**: Clear the success state when button is clicked

### Before (Broken)
```python
with st.form("registration_form"):
    # ... form content ...
    if success:
        st.success("‚úÖ Account created successfully!")
        if st.button("üîê Go to Login"):  # ‚ùå Inside form
            st.rerun()
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
with st.form("registration_form"):
    # ... form content ...
    if success:
        st.success("‚úÖ Account created successfully!")
        # Store success state to show button outside form
        st.session_state.registration_success = True

# Show login button outside the form if registration was successful
if st.session_state.get('registration_success', False):
    if st.button("üîê Go to Login", key="reg_success_login"):  # ‚úÖ Outside form
        st.session_state.registration_success = False
        st.rerun()
```

## Code Changes
- **File**: `app.py`
- **Lines**: ~195-210
- **Change**: Moved login button outside the registration form
- **Method**: Used session state to track registration success

## Indentation Structure
The fix required careful attention to indentation:
- **Form level**: 8 spaces (inside tab)
- **Button level**: 8 spaces (same as form, outside form block)
- **Form content**: 12+ spaces (inside form)

## Testing
Created `check_form_structure.py` to verify the fix:

```
Form starts at line 107 with 8 spaces indentation
Form ends at line 203
‚úÖ No st.button() found inside form
```

## Streamlit Form Rules
For reference, Streamlit form rules:
- ‚úÖ `st.form_submit_button()` - Allowed inside forms
- ‚ùå `st.button()` - Not allowed inside forms
- ‚ùå `st.download_button()` - Not allowed inside forms
- ‚ùå `st.file_uploader()` - Not allowed inside forms (with callback)

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Registration form now works without StreamlitAPIException

The registration process will now work correctly:
1. User fills out registration form
2. On successful registration, success state is stored
3. Login button appears outside the form
4. User can click to proceed to login
